# Problem 
Chef has 10⋅5 + 10⋅10 = 150
10⋅5 + 10⋅10 = 150 rupees in total. Since each chocolate costs 10 rupees, Chef can spend all 150 rupees and buy 15 chocolates for Chefin

# Solution 

we just have to do -- No of coins * 5rs + No of coins * 10rs and then take the integer value of the amount divided by cost of each chocolate 

- [( x * 5 ) + ( y * 10 ) ] / c  ( lets say the price of chocolate c )
