# Problem
7 is not even, hence Alice doesn't like it. It is odd, but isn't a multiple of 9. Hence Bob doesn't like it. Therefore, Charlie takes it home.

# Solution
We just take the remainder by 7 and 9 and then 2 if the solution turns out to zero with 7 and 2 then alice will take number and it the sol is zero with 9 and non zero with 2 then bob takes the number else charlie takes the number.
